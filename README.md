## Purpose of Project

Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) can apply to mobile web application browsers. PWAs ensure that a mobile application can work efficiently without an Internet connection. They use the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses. The purpose of building Budget Tracker is to develop a web application that can connect to a server without needing Internet connectivity. Techniques such as "lazy loading" and the use of installing newer bundles like "webpack" were utilized for this project. The applicaton was finally pushed to Heroku to demonstrate functionality and the efficiency of PWAs.
